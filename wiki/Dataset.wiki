#summary How to add the Dataset to the StripeSpotter Program

== Dataset Guide ==

After completing the DownloadAndInstall guide the StripeSpotter program is now ready to accept a Dataset. One is located under [Downloads], download all three files of the archive (*data.zip, data.z01, data.z02*) place them in the same directory.

*1.* Locate the main directory that contains the *StripeSpotterProgram.exe* program file.

*2.* If there is already a folder named "data", the contents of that directory *might be modified or replaced*. Create a *backup* of this directory if necessary before continuing to further steps. 

*3.* Now open *"data.zip"* from the directory that has all three zip files (*data.zip, data.z01, data.z02*).

*4.* You can directly unzip or "drag and drop" the zipped folder named "data" to the location of the *StripeSpotterProgram.exe*. If there is a folder already named "data", See step *2.*.

*5.* The dataset is now ready to be viewed in the StripeSpotter Program!
